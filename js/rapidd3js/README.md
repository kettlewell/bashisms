# rapidd3js
Source code for Rapid D3.js Course

The course was built using D3.js Version 3.x. Some parts will fail with the latest version 4.x.

## Errata/Changes

The author for the d3-cloud has changed the HTML example page to a JavaScript page (browserify.js) from version 1.2.0.

Reverting to Tag 1.1.2 has the HTML example page as shown in the lesson.
