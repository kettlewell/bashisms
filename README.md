# SNIPS
Just a collection of snippets of code and one-liners that I've acquired, or find
useful in some way shape or form.

This is likely useless to most people.

It's just cobbled together collection of scripts that are likely specific to a
particular task, and generally not generic enough for general consumption.

I could probably put these into gists, but this just seemed easier at the time

I'll probably put these into org-mode files at some point for easier public
consumption but I'm still on my org-mode learning path  :)
