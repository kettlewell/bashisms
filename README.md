# bashisms
Yet Another Misnomer ... A repository of scripts, snippets, clips and oneliners in any language

This is likely useless to most people. It's just cobbled together collection of scripts that are likely specific to a particular task, and generally not generic enough for general consumption.

I could probably put these into gists, but this just seemed easier at the time

## NOTE TO SELF
Rename this repo... something more descriptive, like scriptisms or snippets... snippets may be a descent way to go here
